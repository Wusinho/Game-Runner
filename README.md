# Runner-Game

## About

This is a platform runner game developed using Phaser 3 library. The main character has to jump from the platform in a valley, using a parallax scrolling background. 

The score is increased, for each star and a new bomb spawns every time a star is collected.

You can get a guest name or you can provide one, and once the player dies, your score will be submitted to leaderboard API, only the 10 top scores will appear.

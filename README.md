# Runner-Game

## About

This is a platform runner game developed using Phaser 3 library. The main character has to stay safe jumping between platforms and avoiding bombs.

The score is increased by catching stars and a new bomb spawns every time a star is collected.

You can get a guest name or you can provide one, and once the player dies, your score will be submitted to leaderboard API, only the 10 top scores will appear.

My initial objectives for this game were:

- Make the game functional
- Make the game fun
- Make the game appealing

So far, it is functional and appealing, it is needed more time to achieve all the objectives. 
This could be achieved with more scenes with a more complex story and better animations.
